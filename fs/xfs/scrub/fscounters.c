/*
 * FS Summary Counters
 * ===================
 *
 * The basics of filesystem summary counter checking are that we iterate the
 * AGs counting the number of free blocks, free space btree blocks, per-AG
 * reservations, inodes, delayed allocation reservations, and free inodes.
 * Then we compare what we computed against the in-core counters.
 *
 * However, the reality is that summary counters are a tricky beast to check.
 * While we /could/ freeze the filesystem and scramble around the AGs counting
 * the free blocks, in practice we prefer not do that for a scan because
 * freezing is costly.  To get around this, we added a per-cpu counter of the
 * delalloc reservations so that we can rotor around the AGs relatively
 * quickly, and we allow the counts to be slightly off because we're not taking
 * any locks while we do this.
 *
 * So the first thing we do is warm up the buffer cache in the setup routine by
 * walking all the AGs to make sure the incore per-AG structure has been
 * initialized.  The expected value calculation then iterates the incore per-AG
 * structures as quickly as it can.  We snapshot the percpu counters before and
 * after this operation and use the difference in counter values to guess at
 * our tolerance for mismatch between expected and actual counter values.
 *
 * NOTE: If the calling application has permitted us to repair the counters,
 * we /must/ prevent all other filesystem activity by freezing it.  Since we've
 * frozen the filesystem, we can require an exact match.
 */

/*
 * Since the expected value computation is lockless but only browses incore
 * values, the percpu counters should be fairly close to each other.  However,
 * we'll allow ourselves to be off by at least this (arbitrary) amount.

 * Make sure the per-AG structure has been initialized from the on-disk header

 * summary counters after checking all AG headers).  Do this from the setup
 * function so that the inner AG aggregation loop runs as quickly as possible.
 *
 * This function runs during the setup phase /before/ we start checking any
