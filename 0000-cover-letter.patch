Subject: [PATCH V3 00/10] Bail out if transaction can cause extent count to overflow
To: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org

XFS does not check for possible overflow of per-inode extent counter
fields when adding extents to either data or attr fork.

For e.g.
1. Insert 5 million xattrs (each having a value size of 255 bytes) and
   then delete 50% of them in an alternating manner.

2. On a 4k block sized XFS filesystem instance, the above causes 98511
   extents to be created in the attr fork of the inode.

   xfsaild/loop0  2008 [003]  1475.127209: probe:xfs_inode_to_disk: (ffffffffa43fb6b0) if_nextents=98511 i_ino=131

3. The incore inode fork extent counter is a signed 32-bit
   quantity. However, the on-disk extent counter is an unsigned 16-bit
   quantity and hence cannot hold 98511 extents.

4. The following incorrect value is stored in the xattr extent counter,
   # xfs_db -f -c 'inode 131' -c 'print core.naextents' /dev/loop0
   core.naextents = -32561

This patchset adds a new helper function
(i.e. xfs_iext_count_may_overflow()) to check for overflow of the
per-inode data and xattr extent counters and invokes it before
starting an fs operation (e.g. creating a new directory entry). With
this patchset applied, XFS detects counter overflows and returns with
an error rather than causing a silent corruption.

The patchset has been tested by executing xfstests with the following
mkfs.xfs options,
1. -m crc=0 -b size=1k
2. -m crc=0 -b size=4k
3. -m crc=0 -b size=512
4. -m rmapbt=1,reflink=1 -b size=1k
5. -m rmapbt=1,reflink=1 -b size=4k

The patches can also be obtained from
https://github.com/chandanr/linux.git at branch xfs-reserve-extent-count-v3.

Changelog:
V2 -> V3:
  1. Move the definition of xfs_iext_count_may_overflow() from
     libxfs/xfs_trans_resv.c to libxfs/xfs_inode_fork.c. Also, I tried
     to make xfs_iext_count_may_overflow() an inline function by
     placing the definition in libxfs/xfs_inode_fork.h. However this
     required that the definition of 'struct xfs_inode' be available,
     since xfs_iext_count_may_overflow() uses a 'struct xfs_inode *'
     type variable.
  2. Handle XFS_COW_FORK within xfs_iext_count_may_overflow() by
     returning a success value.
  3. Rename XFS_IEXT_ADD_CNT to XFS_IEXT_ADD_NOSPLIT_CNT. Thanks to
     Darrick for the suggesting the new name.
  4. Expand comments to make use of 80 columns.

V1 -> V2:
  1. Rename helper function from xfs_trans_resv_ext_cnt() to
     xfs_iext_count_may_overflow().
  2. Define and use macros to represent fs operations and the
     corresponding increase in extent count.
  3. Split the patches based on the fs operation being performed.
